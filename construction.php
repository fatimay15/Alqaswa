          <h3>ACRYLIC EMULSION – 3A</h3>
          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p>Acrylic Emulsion – 3A is a fine particle size, acrylic copolymer emulsion. Its moderate film hardness allows binder plasticity to withstand high pigment loads. It also exhibits superior alkali water and weathering resistance.</p>
          <h2>APPLICATION</h2>
          <p>Acrylic Emulsion – 3A has been developed specifically as a binder for coatings where high binding power, adhesion, and film toughness are required. Coatings using Acrylic Emulsion – 3A as a binder exhibit low thickener demand and excellent wet-scrub resistance at high pigment volume concentration.</p>

          <h2>FORMULATION GUIDELINES</h2>
          <h3>PIGMENT</h3>
          <p>Acrylic Emulsion – 3A can be formulated to withstand high pigments and extender loads. It associates with clay so much so that one can use a lesser amount of clay to achieve similar performance characteristics.</p>
          <h3>FILM COALESCING AIDS</h3>
          <p>Coalescing aid is required for optimum film formulation under air-dry applications. The amount will depend on the formulation and drying conditions. Texanol at 5-10% by weight on total dry resin is recommended for adequate filming.</p>
          <h3>THICKENERS</h3>
          <p>Acrylic Emulsion – 3A is designed to have a low thickener demand. Although it may be used to increase the viscosity of a coating based on Acrylic Emulsion - FB, it is important to note that the amount of thickeners required is lower compared to when the same thickener is used in conventional acrylic binders.</p>
          <h3>HIGH PVC PAINTS</h3>
          <p>Acrylic Emulsion – 3A can be formulated to give good wet scrub resistance at high pigment and extender loads using the attached starting formulation.</p>
