                  <p>It is an excellent binder to give soft and pliable fixation in pigment printing. It can be safely used as backfilling agent for woolen and synthetic carpets. In order to achieve permanent and semi-permanent finishes, this could be used along with various resins. This binder imparts excellent fastness to cracking and gives a flexible film that confers excellent handle properties to the fabrics. It is, therefore, recommended for use with synthetic thickeners as well as normal emulsion systems. Pastes prepared with the binder have good stability, fluidity, and spreading properties. The required percentage varies in each case; however, suggest 5-10% by wt. of the total paste.</p>

                <h3>PVA EMULSION TX</h3>
                  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                  <p>PVA TX is an aqueous non-ionic emulsion of poly vinyl acetate. It has a white milky viscous emulsion appearance with a pH value of 4.5 - 5.5. The viscosity is 200-250 Poise at 25°C (Rion viscotester VT - 04), and the solid content is 49% +/- 1%. It is soluble in hot and cold water in all proportions and exhibits stability in weak acids, alkalis, and optical whitening agents.</p>
                  <h2>PROPERTIES</h2>
                  <p>PVA TX can be safely used for white as well as dyed finishing of textile. It is compatible with various resins and softening agents, making it suitable for cotton and blended fabrics.</p>
                  <h2>APPLICATION</h2>
                  <p>PVA TX is generally accepted by all textile fibers. It is commonly applied by padding, but other methods such as winch, jig, shallow vat, or spraying apparatus can be used if necessary. The concentration required depends on the material, with a recommended ratio of 12-48 parts of Resins per 1000 parts of water for a general fabric finish.</p>

          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p>PVA TXP-20 is an aqueous non-ionic emulsion of plasticized poly vinyl acetate. It has a white milky viscous emulsion appearance with a pH value of 4.5 - 5.5. The viscosity is 130-180 Poise at 25°C (Rion viscotester VT - 04), and the solid content is 40% +/- 2%. It is soluble in hot and cold water in all proportions and exhibits stability in weak acids, alkalis, and optical whitening agents.</p>
          <h2>PROPERTIES</h2>
          <p>PVA TXP-20 leaves a transparent film on drying and does not affect or tint the base material. It can be safely used for white as well as dyed finishing of textile. PVA TXP-20 is compatible with various resins and softening agents, providing a full soft and elastic handle.</p>
          <h2>APPLICATION</h2>
          <p>PVA TXP-20 is generally accepted by all textile fibers. It is commonly applied by padding, but other methods such as winch, jig, shallow vat, or spraying apparatus can be used if necessary. The concentration required depends on the material, with a recommended ratio of 12-48 parts of resins per 1000 parts of water for a general fabric finish.</p>
          <p>The temperature for calendaring should not exceed 60°C as otherwise the product, because of its thermoplasticity, may be deposited on the calendar roller.</p>
